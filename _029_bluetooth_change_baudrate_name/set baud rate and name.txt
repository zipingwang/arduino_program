1. Test communication
Send: AT (please send it every second)
Back: OK
2. Reset the Bluetooth serial baud rate
Send: AT+BAUD1
Back: OK1200
Send: AT+BAUD2
Back: OK2400
……
1---------1200
2---------2400
3---------4800
4---------9600 (Default)
5---------19200
6---------38400
7---------57600
8---------115200
9---------230400
A---------460800
B---------921600
C---------1382400
PC can’t support the baud rate lager than 115200. The solution is: make the MCU have higher baud
rate (lager than 115200) through programming, and reset the baud rate to low level through the AT
command.
The baud rate reset by the AT command can be kept for the next time even though the power is cut
off.
3. Reset the Bluetooth name
Send: AT+NAMEname
Back: OKname

4. change the Bluetooth pair password
Send: AT+PINxxxx
Back:OKsetpin
Parameter xxxx: The pair password needed to be set, is a 4-bits number. This command can be used
in the master and slave module. At some occasions, the master module may be asked to enter the
password when the master module tries to connect the slave module (adapter or cell-phone). Only if the
password is entered, the successful connection can be built. At the other occasions, the pair can be finish
automatically if the master module can search the proper slave module and the password is correct.
Besides the paired slave module, the master can connect the other devices who have slave module, such
as Bluetooth digital camera, Bluetooth GPS, Bluetooth serial printer etc.
Example:
Send: AT+PIN8888
Back: OKsetpin
Then the password is changed to be 8888, while the default is 1234.
This parameter can be kept even though the power is cut off.
